This is My simple code project to show my interest toward the cyber security.
This program will cipher any plain text into encrypted text by using caesarcipher method. In this method I used python language.
Basically, caesarcipher is work by shifting each leter in the plaintext by a fixed number position in the alphabet. Like there is "abcdedf" and shift is: 4 means a = e. Therefore, "hello" alphabet with shift =2 
is: "llohe".
In here the main use is string slice method which helps to slice the alphabet for the ciphering and used concatination method to combine. This all process happend inside a function called cipher().
In this program user can input any strings and can decide any shift to cipher the string.
